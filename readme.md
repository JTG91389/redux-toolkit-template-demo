## What is this project

This project was created using the NPX redux toolkit template project. See the below command to repeat this app creation on your own if you wish to. 

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template redux
```

We will use this project to have a consistent demo project to walk through Redux toolkit and for practicing redux debugging using the [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/tree/main/extension) Chrome extension. 

Install the Redux Devtools Chrome Extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)

You should use this project in conjunction with the [unit 5: Redux and React Hooks lesson 4 and lesson 5](https://git.generalassemb.ly/Market-Axess/react-accelerator-20230123).
